A Java port of the python-pathfinding repository.

Computes mathematically optimal paths from one point to the other on a mostly
open board. It does this through Dijkstra's algorithm, a custom line-of-sight
algorithm, and a massive amount of various other helper algorithms, including a
polygon triangulation algorithm and a polygon expansion algorithm.

**Warning:** This code only compiles, in it's current state, this port has
received absolutely *no* testing. You're more likely to get struck down by a
ferocious bobcat sent to you through FedEx by some person on Ebay, only to be
saved by a strike of lightning, which also just so happens to cause a wind
current from the east that delivers into your hands one winning lottery ticket
than to have success with this code in it's current state. *(Two XKCD references
for the price of one sentence! The first one is easy to spot, can you locate the
second?)*
